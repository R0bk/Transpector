# üî¨ Transpector
Visually inspect, analyse and debug transformer models. Aimed at reducing cycle times for interpretability research and lowering the barrier to entry.
## Getting Started

To use Transpector first install the package `pip install transpector` then you can start it from the command line with `transpector`. Once it's ready, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html` to get started.

#### Using Transpector

Coming soon!
## Developing locally

In it's development setting currently you have to run two parts, a python script kicking off Jupyter Server (this spawns a fastAPI backend in the same event loop as the IPython Kernal), and a Next JS Server. Next JS will be compiled and served as a static file from fastAPI eventually.

To run Next JS
```bash
npm run dev
```

To launch the python side
```bash
python launch.py
```

### Building the package

First build the next js into a static output doing
```
npm run build
```

Then copy the static out folder from `./out` to `./transpector/frontend_dist`.

Now you can build the python package by doing.

```
python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist
```
You should see that the static files are included in the distribution from the output from the build command. Now we can install the package using

```
pip install dist/<build-name>
```

And finally, use our installed package to run the server:
```
transpector run
```
